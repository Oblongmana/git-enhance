#git-enhance

A collection of things I've lumped into my bash_profile to help me work harder/better/faster/stronger with git

Note that I've personally mostly stopped using this, and am now using
[Oblongmana/oblong-hub](https://github.com/Oblongmana/oblong-hub) instead, as:
* it takes care of all the ins and outs of wrapping git without me having to think about it;
* it's primarily in ruby, not bash - bash really isn't suitable for anything of reasonable complexity, like wrapping/extending git;
* adding more extensions is SUPER easy.

In fact I'm not sure why you're still reading this readme and haven't yet gone to [Oblongmana/oblong-hub](https://github.com/Oblongmana/oblong-hub)
